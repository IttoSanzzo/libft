## About It

-   A normal libft normally made for the [Rio's Ecolle 42](https://42.rio) libft project. This, too was done initially for that purpose as well. But, once validated in the cursos, I started to implement my own stuff in it, so now it's... pretty big, and a lot useful.
-   All of it's functions are still in according to the [42's Coding Norme](https://github.com/MagicHatJo/-42-Norm/blob/master/norme.en.pdf).

## Usage

-   Compile it using the `make` command, and then the `libft.a` file will be generated. You can then use it, together with it's header `libft.h`, located at the includes directory, in any C project or equivalent.
-   There are dozens of functions in it (170 to be precise), for `string manipulation`, `array manipulation`, `memory control`, `conversions between different types`, `chained lists`, `stdlib utils`, a personal `readline` function, and even more.
-   I won't be writting a formal documentation for it, since it was not mean't to be used by others, but if you want a hand, just send me a message at discord, and I will gladly explain any funtion in it.
